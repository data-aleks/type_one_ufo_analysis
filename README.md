# ðŸ›¸ UFO Sighting Data Analysis - Real World Data From NUFORC and OURWORLDINDATA

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis of real-world UFO sightings, correlating them with publicly available astronomical and space-related data. The primary objective is to obtain, clean, process, and analyze reported UFO incidents to identify patterns, trends, and potential relationships with known publicly available data.

## Data Sources
This analysis leverages data from the following reputable sources:

- **UFO Sightings Data**:  
  [National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)](https://nuforc.org) â€” Provides a comprehensive database of reported UFO sightings, including date, time, location, shape, and duration.

- **Space & Astronomical Data**:  
  [Our World in Data â€” Space Exploration](https://ourworldindata.org/space-exploration) â€” A rich source for data on space launches, orbiting objects, and other space-related statistics.

## Analysis Goals and Features

- **Data acquisition**
  Obtaining real world data using a python scraper

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
  Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and transforming raw data into a usable structure for analysis.

- **Correlation Studies**:  
  Exploring potential relationships between UFO sightings and external astronomical or man-made activities.

- **Visualizations**:  
  Leveraging charts and graphs to convey patterns and anomalies across time and geography.
